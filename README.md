- 👋 Hi, I’m @KranthiKumar1803 
- 👀 I’m interested in latest Software technologies and programming language like Java and its API services. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Backend Java programming and Integration of Microservices using Spring and Spring Boot Architecture, Kafka with MySQL DB. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on team work with any sort of major minor projects which will give me exposure to the newer side of the software dev tools.
